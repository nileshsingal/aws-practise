## Amazon Simple Storage Service


* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. 
You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, 
from anywhere on the web. You can accomplish these tasks using the AWS Management Console, 
which is a simple and intuitive web interface.


* When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Amazon S3. 
You are charged only for the services that you use.


**With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use.**
